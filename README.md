# Komoot Challenge

## Assignment

Develop a react app that enables you to plan your cross country run and download it as GPX file.

Cross Country runners are not bound to the streets.
Your users can plan their favorite route across fields and
hills by just placing markers as waypoints on the map.
For detailed planning the same waypoints show up as a list where
users can delete and rearrange them until the route is perfect and ready to download.
The user interface should be based on the design to the left. 

An excellent ReactJS Developer should manage to do this challenge in a few hours.
Impress us with your coding skills by not using 3rd party react components and plugins.
At least the map and the list should be separated react components.

Send us the sources as zip file, a link to the hosted solution and
what you have learned while developing.
